# ToDo App

## Description

ToDo is a simple app created solely in Vue.js 3.x, which helps you keep track of your everyday activities! You can add a task, remove it after it's done and if your list is long and you don't want to manually search for a specific task - there is a search option stored in the same input field! A simple, minimalistic design makes the app clear and super easy to use - without any unneccessary impediments.
